          When &quot;rate&quot; is selected, the chart shows the percent of the

          When a supervision type and/or office is selected, the rate is the
          number of people with revocations who match the selected filters

          the selected filters.

          Revocations are considered probation revocations or parole revocations
          based on the DOCR admission reason. Because only one reason can be
          selected, an individual&apos;s revocation will count only towards
          EITHER parole or probation even if they were on both parole and
          probation prior to incarceration.

          Revocations are attributed to the site of the terminating officer on

          Unsuccessful completions of supervision occur when the supervision

          Deaths, suspensions, and &quot;other&quot; terminations are excluded

          While on supervision, individuals are attributed to the office of

        <li>
          Prison admissions are categorized as probation revocations, parole

          When an individual has multiple violation types leading to revocation,

          technicals.

          Revocations are included based on the date that the person was

          Prison admissions are categorized as probation revocations, parole

        <li>
          &quot;Technical Revocations&quot; include only those revocations which
          result solely from a technical violation. If there is a violation that

          &quot;Non-Technical Revocation&quot;.

          admissions are linked to supervision cases closed via revocation

          If a supervision type (parole or probation) is selected, the
          revocation and supervision populations will only count individuals
          meeting that criteria. Revocations are classified as either a parole
          revocation or a probation revocation based on the admission reason.
          Individuals can, however, appear in both the parole supervision
          population and the probation supervision population if they have both
          parole & probation active supervision cases.
